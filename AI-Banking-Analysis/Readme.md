# AI Banking Analysis (AI-Assisted Analytics)

## Overview
This project demonstrates AI-assisted data analytics by leveraging large language models to support the end-to-end analytics workflow — from dataset generation and cleaning to KPI design and visualization. The project focuses on effective prompt engineering and validation rather than manual data creation.

AI tools were used as analytical assistants, while the overall problem framing, requirements, and evaluation were driven by the analyst.

## Problem Statement
Banking analytics involves complex datasets, multiple KPIs, and structured cleaning workflows.  
This project explores how AI models can be effectively used to accelerate data generation, cleaning, and visualization when guided by clear analytical requirements.

---

## Approach & Workflow
1. Generated a synthetic banking dataset using AI-generated SQL queries  
2. Loaded unclean data into SQL Server  
3. Cleaned and transformed data within SQL Server using AI-suggested SQL queries  
4. Defined business requirements and analytical goals via prompts  
5. Designed KPIs and visualizations based on AI-assisted recommendations  
6. Created DAX measures using AI guidance and validated results

## Dataset
- Type: Synthetic banking dataset
- Generated using AI-assisted SQL queries
- Initial state: Unclean and inconsistent
- Cleaning performed directly in SQL Server

> Note: Dataset is synthetic and used for learning and demonstration purposes.
