## 📊 Project 1: Banking Analysis  
📁 **Path:** `AI-Python-Projects/Banking-Analysis`

### 🔍 Project Overview
This project simulates a banking-related dataset and performs an end-to-end data analysis workflow to identify key performance indicators (KPIs), visualize trends, generate reports, and provide actionable business insights.

The analysis is executed as a **Data Analyst working in Jupyter Notebook**, following real-world analytical practices.

### 🧾 Prompt Used – Banking Analysis

Think of yourself to be a data analyst.
And you are using Jupyter Notebook.
And you need to execute a Python project as instructed in the below mentioned steps.
Create separate answer blocks for each step.
Step one write Python script to create banking related data frame and suggest KPIs and metrics that
can be represented using charts and this particular data set.
Step two.
Also write Python script to install packages required for this project.
We have already installed numpy.
Pandas.
Matplotlib.
Seaborn.
Y data profiling and Reportlab.
Let us know of additional packages if needed.
I want to install them using Anaconda prompt, so write the command accordingly if required.
Step three write Python script that will help me understand the data better.
Step four Write Python script to clean the data wherever required.
And step five Write Python script to import required libraries and create five charts to represent five
KPIs.
Create the charts.
I am mentioning bar chart, line chart, scatter plot, pie chart and doughnut chart.
Step six.
Write the Python script to export the PDF report consisting of the charts.
Step seven tell me about insights and give recommendations, if any.
