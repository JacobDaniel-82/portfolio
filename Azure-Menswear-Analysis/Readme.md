# Azure Menswear Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding how Microsoft Azure can be used as a data source, backend server, and database for analytics workflows. The project explores integrating Azure services with Power BI using a menswear (T-shirt) sales dataset as the analytical context.

The primary goal of this project is to learn cloud-based data handling and BI integration rather than deep analytical modeling.

---

## Problem Statement
Modern analytics systems increasingly rely on cloud platforms for scalable data storage and processing.  
This project aims to understand how Azure services can be used to host data and connect seamlessly with business intelligence tools like Power BI for analysis and visualization.

---

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Azure as a cloud data platform
- Learn how databases and services are managed in Azure
