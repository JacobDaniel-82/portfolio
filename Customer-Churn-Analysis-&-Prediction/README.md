# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

**Tools Used:** SQL, Python, Power BI  
**Project Overview:**  
End-to-end churn analysis and prediction pipeline that combines SQL data prep, Power BI dashboards for business insights, and a Random Forest model (Python / Jupyter) to predict customers at risk of churning. The project contains data cleaning, feature engineering (Power Query / SQL), exploratory analysis, model training/evaluation, and production-ready prediction exports.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Identify customers likely to churn and enable proactive retention actions.
- Provide business-facing dashboards showing churn trends, revenue impact, and segment-level risk.
- Deliver a reproducible ML pipeline to predict churn and export predicted churners for downstream action.

## ðŸ“¥ Data
- Primary file: `data/customer-data.csv` (or `Prediction_Data.xlsx` in your local workflow).  
- Views created for reporting & modeling:
  - `vw_ChurnData` â†’ customers with statuses `Churned` or `Stayed` (used for model)
  - `vw_JoinData` â†’ customers with status `Joined` (used for inference / joiner analysis)
