# GCP Housing Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding how Google Cloud Platform (GCP) can be used as a data source for analytics and business intelligence workflows. Using a housing market dataset, the project explores how data can be accessed from BigQuery and connected to Power BI for market analysis and visualization.

The project emphasizes learning cloud-based data integration rather than full-scale deployment.
