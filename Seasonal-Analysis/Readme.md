# Seasonal Data Analysis (Snowflake + Power BI)

## Overview
This project analyzes seasonal patterns using weather and yield-related data by leveraging Snowflake as the cloud data warehouse and Power BI for visualization. Data transformation and cleaning were performed directly within Snowflake using SQL worksheets, followed by visualization in Power BI.

The project focuses on understanding cloud-based analytics workflows and seasonal trend analysis.
